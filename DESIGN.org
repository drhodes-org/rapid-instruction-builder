*** Layers
**** Logic
***** Shapes
      - Uses common/BoundingBox
      - Circle
      - Box
      - LineSegment
      - Path
      - Color
        - Filled
        - Stroke

***** Constraint system
      - computation restricted to power of regular expressions
      - 
****** Relationships:
       - 1-to-1 items.
       - consider n-to-m, watchout for quadratic 

**** Display
***** ElementMgr
      - Manages raphael objects for Display.
      
***** Raphael
****** The model
       - persistant
       - handles updates, so main app doesn't need to deal with screen
         refreshes at all.
       - main app requests primitives objects

**** Common
     - Common elements to other layers. May be geometric
***** Color
***** BoundingBox
      - BoundingBoxI
      - BoundingBox is constrainable.        
        - example.  
          - Constrain the top of a bounding box to a line segment.
          - Constrain the center of the bounding box to the mouse pos.
          - Constrain the center of the bounding box OF the circle
            called "my-circle" to the line segment called
            "my-line-segment"
