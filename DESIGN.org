* Rapid Instruction Builder
** constraint system
- computation restricted to power of regular expressions
*** relationships may exist between:
- 1-to-1 items.
- consider n-to-m, watchout for quadratic 

** display backend
*** raphael
**** The model
- persistant
- handles updates, so main app doesn't need to deal with screen refreshes at all.
- main app requests primitives objects
